# javascript-notes
Just some javascript miscellany. Please take a look at the test cases associated with file to glean the point of the example. Mostly, the code here deals with concepts related to the language itself, not really how it behaves in the browser.

## Requirements
You need to have [node]('https://nodejs.org/en/') and either [yarn]('https://yarnpkg.com/en/') or [npm]('https://www.npmjs.com/')installed.

## Installation
Do a `yarn` or `npm install` in the root directory to install the required packages.

## Usage
You can do `node somemodule.js` to just run the file and see the output. To run tests, go to the root directory and do `yarn test` or `npm test`.
